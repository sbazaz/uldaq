//
// Purpose:
//
//    This firmware implements the ANCHOR_LOAD_EXTERNAL vendor specific command.
//    Firmware Intel Hex Records generated by hex2c.
//
// Environment:
//    kernel mode
//
// $Author: Mdn $
//
// $History: loader.c $           
//  
//  *****************  Version 2  *****************
//  User: Mdn          Date: 7/19/01    Time: 10:36a
//  Updated in $/USB/Drivers/ezloader
//  loader.c is now based on the a3load.hex firmware.  Previously, the
//  loader was based on the vend_ax firmware, but that firmware is chip
//  specific - the same binary will not work on both EZ-USB and FX2.
//  a3load works on both EZ-USB and FX2.
